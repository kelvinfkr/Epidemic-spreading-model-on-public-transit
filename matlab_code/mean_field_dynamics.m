function [r_0,p_i,p_e] = dynamics(parameters_e,parameters_i,coefs_e,coefs_i,pi0,pe0,transit_rate)
% to use this function, people need to prepare
% the dynamics parameters for disease process
% the coeficients should be fitted use the data generated by the numerical
% model
% paremeters and coefs are factors of the regression model correspondingly.
% we also need the initial condition for the disease process (pi0,pe0).
% the transit rate is the probability for people to transit from infected
% to recovered
% the model should be scaled to fit different network capacity by scaling the input parameters and initial conditions.
